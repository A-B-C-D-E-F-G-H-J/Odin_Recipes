      <ul> 
            <li>10 short ribs, (rib pieces cut into 3 to 4-inch, 10 to 12 cm, chunks)</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (375ml) dark beer</li>
            <li>10 garlic cloves, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>1- inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Chinese or Japanese rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 ounces (50g) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
            <li>1 cup (250ml) hoisin sauce</li>
      </ul></div>
    </div>
        <p style="text-align:center">Toss the ribs in salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large roasting pan and fry the short ribs until 
            each side is very dark and well-caramelized. Don’t skimp and it may take up to an hour to get them all 
            done. If your pan isn’t big enough, you can brown them in batches, or do some in a separate pan.</p>
        <p style="text-align:center">Remove the ribs from the pan, then turn off the heat and deglaze the pan with the beer. Scrape up 
            the browned bits stuck to the pan with a firm spatula, then add the garlic and ginger, stirring to 
            cook them in a residual heat of the pan.</p>
        <p style="text-align:center">Preheat the oven to 325F. (160C)</p>
        <p style="text-align:center">Add the ribs back to the pan and mix in the vinegar, chocolate, and chili powder.</p>
        <p style="text-align:center">Cover and let simmer for 3 hours, turning the short ribs a few times while they’re cooking. The ribs 
            are done when they’re fork-tender and falling off the bone. (During cooking, you may need to add a bit 
            of water to the pan if the liquid evaporates too much.)</p>
        <p style="text-align:center">Remove the cover, stir in the hoisin sauce, reduce the heat to 300C (150C) and cook for another 30 minutes.</p>
